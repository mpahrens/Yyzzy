As a game designer
- I want to be able to specify the default behavior of the game world and game objects (basic entities)
- I want to be able to specify some reusable game behavior e.g. movement, default AI, taking a turn
- I want to be able to apply a game behavior to a particular entity
- I want to be able to apply a game behavior to all entities of a role
- I want to be able to define a role
  - I might want to be able to infer a role
- I want to be able to say a role should have specific properties
