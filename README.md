# Yyzzy
Pronounced "ez".  
Serverside-game framework for Elixir to make complicated things _easy_.
## Purpose
a Data Driven, functional, server-side alternative to the OOP create-update-render-destroy model to Games, Game Objects, and Screens.
#### TODO
Main internals are TBD but the gist is to combine some features of propagators as FRP Behaviors, and Entity Oriented Design (that is, we don't care about what game objects are at every step, we just transform over them since they are data). This section will be fleshed out as we make some decisions.

## Features
Please See Features.md
## Getting started
Examples and Wikis are coming soon, please see Examples.md

## Disclaimer
Currently this software is as pre-alpha as you can get. Please feel free to check in on it every so often or even make suggestions using the issue tracker, but note that it isn't something to be considered usable until v0.1.0 with the release of the DSL and some examples.
